# 03. Basic operations and arithmetic
Python supports all the basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, Python also supports more advanced mathematical operations such as exponentiation, modulus, and floor division.

## Basic Mathematical Operations
In Python, you can perform basic mathematical operations using the following operators:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

In Python, addition is performed using the `+` operator, subtraction using the `-` operator, multiplication using the `*` operator, and division using the `/` operator.

For example, if we want to add two numbers, we can use the following code:
```python
a = 5
b = 3
c = a + b
print(c)
```
This code will output the value of `c`, which is the result of adding `a` and `b`, which is `8`. Similarly, we can perform subtraction, multiplication, and division using the `-` , `*` , and `/` operators, respectively.

## Exponentiation

In addition to the basic mathematical operations, Python also supports more advanced mathematical operations. The `**` operator is used for exponentiation, which means raising a number to a power. 

For example, if we want to find the value of 2 raised to the power of 3, we can use the following code:

```python
a = 2
b = 3
c = a ** b
print(c)
```
This code will output the value of `c`, which is the result of `2` raised to the power of `3`, which is `8`.
## Modulus
The `%` operator is used for modulus, which means finding the remainder of a division operation. 

For example, if we want to find the remainder when `7` is divided by `3`, we can use the following code:

```python
a = 7
b = 3
c = a % b
print(c)
```

This code will output the value of `c`, which is the remainder when `7` is divided by `3`, which is `1`.

## Floor Division
Finally, the `//` operator is used for floor division, which means dividing two numbers and rounding down to the nearest integer.

For example, if we want to find the result of dividing `7` by `3` and rounding down to the nearest integer, we can use the following code:

```python
a = 7
b = 3
c = a // b
print(c)
```
This code will output the value of `c`, which is the result of dividing `7` by `3` and rounding down to the nearest integer, which is `2`.
